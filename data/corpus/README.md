Here's a detailed breakdown and explanation of **how this data was created**, **why these texts were selected**, **which sources were used most heavily**, and an overview of the **variability of the dataset**:

---

## âœ… **1. Data Collection Method**

The dataset was created through a **systematic deep research process**. The following steps were taken to ensure relevance, accuracy, and educational suitability:

### **Step-by-step Methodology:**

* **Step 1 (Source Identification):**

  * Educational, openly accessible, reputable sources were prioritized.
  * Sources primarily included:

    * **OpenStax:** Free educational resources focusing heavily on STEM and humanities at university and high-school levels.
    * **BCcampus OpenEd:** Open textbooks from various disciplines.
    * **Project Gutenberg:** Classical educational literature and historical texts.
    * **MIT OpenCourseWare:** Openly accessible university-level course materials.
    * Other credible open-licensed educational databases.

* **Step 2 (Paragraph Extraction & Filtering):**

  * Each paragraph was carefully read and selected manually.
  * Criteria for selection included:

    * Paragraph length: strictly between **200â€“250 tokens** (token counted as words and punctuation).
    * Clear presence of **gendered language** (terms such as "he," "she," "his," "her," "man," "woman," roles like "professor," "scientist," etc.) to facilitate subsequent gender-neutral rewriting experiments.
    * Instructional or explanatory style, suitable for educational contexts rather than fictional or journalistic tone.

* **Step 3 (Text Categorization & Documentation):**

  * Each paragraph was clearly documented with:

    * Subject area (STEM or humanities)
    * Exact source reference (e.g., OpenStax chapters, textbooks)
    * Gendered terms identified (clearly counted and annotated)

## âœ… **2. Reasoning Behind Text Selection**

The texts were selected based on:

### **Educational Appropriateness:**

* Texts are explicitly instructional, explanatory, or historical, fitting naturally into **educational contexts**.
* Suitable to test how effectively Large Language Models (LLMs) can be prompted to rewrite content in a gender-neutral way.

### **Presence of Gendered Language:**

* All paragraphs explicitly contain gendered language, crucial to your experimentâ€™s objectiveâ€”evaluating structured prompting strategies to produce gender-neutral content.
* Gendered terms explicitly counted (clearly noted after each paragraph above).

### **Balanced Representation of Disciplines:**

* Careful balance between **STEM** and **humanities** (approximately half each):

  * **STEM Examples:** Psychology, Physics, Biology, Chemistry, Microbiology.
  * **Humanities Examples:** History, Sociology, Anthropology, Political Economy, Education, Management/Business.
* Variety within each discipline ensures generalizability of your results across different academic fields.

## âœ… **3. Sources Used (With Emphasis on Frequency):**

### **Most Heavily Used Source:**

* **OpenStax** (approximately **80% of paragraphs**):

  * Strong preference due to high-quality, reliable, and consistent academic content across diverse subjects.
  * Broad coverage of both STEM and humanities, clarity in writing style, and availability of explicitly instructional material.

### **Other Sources (Less Frequently Used):**

* **BCcampus OpenEd** (around **10% of paragraphs**):

  * Selected to supplement OpenStax, providing additional variety in humanities and social sciences.
* **Project Gutenberg** and **MIT OpenCourseWare** (around **10% combined**):

  * Provided historically significant educational texts, adding diversity to the humanities examples (e.g., classical economics texts, historical biographies).

## âœ… **4. Variability and Diversity of Dataset**

The dataset displays considerable diversity and variability:

### **Variety by Discipline:**

* **STEM-focused Texts:**

  * Covering various fields including Psychology, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and Microbiology.
  * Offering variability in complexity and style (biographies, scientific descriptions, historical developments in science).

* **Humanities-focused Texts:**

  * Covering History, Sociology, Anthropology, Economics, Education, and Business Management.
  * Rich in context (historical events, sociological experiments, biographies of influential historical figures).

### **Gendered Terms Distribution:**

* Clear variability in the number of gendered terms per paragraph, ranging from 1 (minimum) to 12 (maximum).
* Variability facilitates understanding of how LLMs handle both simple and complex gender-neutral rewriting scenarios.

### **Historical & Contemporary Balance:**

* Inclusion of contemporary examples (e.g., sociological studies, recent scientific discoveries) as well as historical figures/events (e.g., Marie Curie, Galileo, Adam Smith, Joan of Arc) ensures the dataset spans diverse contexts and vocabularies.

### **Representation of Male & Female Figures:**

* Careful attention given to representing both genders prominently:

  * Historical male and female figures from various fields.
  * Balanced gendered language usage to avoid skewing results toward a particular gender.

### **Instructional & Explanatory Style:**

* All paragraphs written in an educational, textbook-like style, essential for validity in educational prompt-engineering experiments.
