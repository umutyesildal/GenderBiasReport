Here's a very detailed explanation of **why you chose each prompt strategy** and **why you're using these specific evaluation metrics**. This structured explanation can be clearly understood by an AI, assisting it in writing your research paper effectively.

# ðŸš© **1. Explanation of Prompting Strategies**

In the experiment, four structured prompting strategies are selected to test their effectiveness in producing gender-neutral educational texts. Each strategy has specific goals and hypotheses:

---

### **1. Raw Prompt (Control Condition)**

**Definition:**
A basic, unstructured prompt with no specific instructions regarding gender neutrality.

**Example Prompt:**

> "Rewrite the following paragraph clearly:
> \[Original paragraph]."

**Reason for Selection:**

* Serves as a baseline to measure the default gender bias of the LLM without intervention.
* Establishes a control condition that allows clear assessment of how structured prompts improve gender neutrality.
* Provides empirical evidence of inherent biases in model outputs when no explicit direction is given.

**Expected Outcome:**

* Higher gender bias, as the LLM will typically default to existing biases learned during training.
* Serves as a clear reference point for evaluating improvements achieved by structured prompts.

---

### **2. System Prompt (Explicit Instruction)**

**Definition:**
A prompt that explicitly assigns the LLM a defined role ("Inclusive writing assistant") with instructions to rewrite text gender-neutrally.

**Example Prompt:**

> **System message:**
> "You are an inclusive writing assistant. Rewrite the following text using gender-neutral language."
>
> **User message:**
> "\[Original paragraph]."

**Reason for Selection:**

* Explicitly defining the modelâ€™s role sets clear expectations, leveraging the LLMâ€™s ability to follow structured instructions.
* Based on literature (Zeng et al., 2024), explicit role-based prompting significantly reduces biases by clearly directing the LLM towards desired outcomes.
* Tests how well the model adheres to role-based guidance alone, without specific examples provided.

**Expected Outcome:**

* Reduced gender bias compared to raw prompt.
* Potential improvement in fluency due to clarity of the instruction, but still limited by absence of explicit examples.

---

### **3. Few-Shot Prompt (Example-Based Instruction)**

**Definition:**
A structured prompt that provides explicit examples (few-shot learning) demonstrating desired gender-neutral language usage.

**Example Prompt:**

> **System message:**
> "You are an inclusive writing assistant. Rewrite the text using gender-neutral language."
>
> **User message:**
> "Here are two examples:
>
> * Original: 'Every student must submit his paper.'
>   Neutral: 'All students must submit their papers.'
> * Original: 'A professor encourages his students.'
>   Neutral: 'Professors encourage their students.'
>
> Now rewrite this paragraph gender-neutrally:
> \[Original paragraph]."

**Reason for Selection:**

* Few-shot learning has been empirically validated to significantly reduce biases (Zeng et al., 2024; Savoldi et al., 2024).
* Provides the model with direct, practical examples of how gender-neutral rewriting should be performed.
* Tests the hypothesis that providing clear exemplars markedly improves the quality and consistency of generated neutral text.

**Expected Outcome:**

* Significant reduction in gender bias compared to both Raw and System prompts.
* Improved fluency and correctness in gender-neutral phrasing.
* Expected as one of the most effective prompting methods based on prior research.

### **4. Few-Shot + Verification Prompt (Example + Check)**

**Definition:**
An extension of Few-Shot prompting by including an additional verification step instructing the model to explicitly check and correct any residual gendered terms.

**Example Prompt:**

> **System message:**
> "You are an inclusive writing assistant. Rewrite the text using gender-neutral language."
>
> **User message:**
> "\[Include the Few-Shot examples as above].
>
> After rewriting, check: 'Are there still gendered terms (he/she/man/woman, etc.)? If yes, rewrite fully gender-neutral.'"

**Reason for Selection:**

* Adds a built-in verification step to reduce residual bias even further.
* Based on literature, prompts that include a verification step have shown to yield incremental improvements (Savoldi et al., 2024; Zeng et al., 2024).
* Tests if self-verification effectively catches and corrects subtle biases or overlooked gendered expressions.

**Expected Outcome:**

* Lowest overall gender bias among all prompting strategies.
* Ensures very high fluency and accuracy due to the explicit final correction step.
* Tests practical viability of multi-step prompting workflows for educational contexts.

# ðŸš© **2. Explanation of Evaluation Metrics**

Evaluation metrics were chosen to comprehensively assess three critical dimensions of your LLM-generated outputs: **Gender Bias, Fluency, and Meaning Preservation**.

---

### **1. Gender Bias Score (Automatic + Manual)**

**Definition:**
Measures the proportion of gendered terms (like he/she/man/woman) present in the output.

**Rationale for Selection:**

* Clearly quantifies how effectively each prompt reduces gendered language.
* Combination of automatic detection (via regex patterns) and manual verification ensures robust accuracy.
* Rooted in prior validated studies (Urchs et al., 2024; Zeng et al., 2024; Zhao et al., 2024).

**Expected Utility:**

* Provides quantitative and qualitative validation of bias reduction.
* Offers empirical evidence to compare effectiveness across prompting strategies.

---

### **2. Fluency (Human-rated)**

**Definition:**
Human raters independently evaluate how natural and readable the rewritten texts are on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = poor, 5 = excellent).

**Rationale for Selection:**

* Essential to validate that bias mitigation does not negatively impact readability or clarity.
* Fluency rating by multiple independent evaluators reduces subjective biases and ensures reliability (addressing professorâ€™s feedback).
* Supported by literature highlighting the importance of human ratings for readability (Savoldi et al., 2024).

**Expected Utility:**

* Confirms the practical applicability of prompting strategies in realistic educational scenarios.
* Helps detect possible trade-offs between bias reduction and readability.

---

### **3. Meaning Preservation (BLEU-4 Similarity)**

**Definition:**
Measures how closely the generated texts match the original meaning by comparing outputs to original paragraphs using BLEU-4, a widely used metric in NLP.

**Rationale for Selection:**

* Ensures that rewriting for gender neutrality doesnâ€™t significantly alter or distort the original instructional content.
* Objectively quantifies semantic consistency of outputs.
* Supported by prior studies utilizing BLEU scores for meaning evaluation (Savoldi et al., 2024).

**Expected Utility:**

* Confirms accuracy of rewrites beyond just gender neutrality, critical in educational contexts.
* Ensures educational integrity is maintained.
